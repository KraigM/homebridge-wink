# Device support

## Air Conditioners

_Wink Aros_

* Change between cool, auto and off.
* Set temperature.

Limitations:

* Direct fan control is not yet available.

## Binary Switches

_Z-Wave non-dimming switches, Wink Outlink, Wink Relay_

* On/Off Functions.
* For the Outlink, uses the power usage to determine if on or off.
* Can be added to HomeKit as a fan, using `fan_ids` optional configuration field

Limitations:

* Does not report actual power usage due to limitation in HomeKit Interface.

## Cameras

_Arlo, Canary, Nest Cam_

* Added to HomeKit as motion detector.
* Canary is added to HomeKit as security system:
  * Allows user to set the operating mode (armed, disarmed, etc).

Limitations:

* Can not view video feed.
* Cameras other than Canary are not added as a security system (as I'm not sure which modes each camera supports and how they map to HomeKit states).

## Fans

_Home Decorators Collection fans_

* On/Off, rotation direction and speed.

Limitations:

* Can not control Comfort Breeze / auto mode.

## Garage Doors

* Open/Close Wink-connected garage doors.
* Reports Battery Level (where available).

Limitations:

* Bulbs with support allow Hue and Saturation.
* Can be added to HomeKit as a fan, using `fan_ids` optional configuration field

## Locks

* Reports Battery Level (where available).

Limitations:

* Does not support tamper detection due to limitation in developer's locks and/or Wink API.

## Propane Tank

## Sensors

_Spotter, Tripper and other PIR and Door/Window Sensors_

* The following sensors are supported:
  * Humidity sensor

  * automatically if device's name contains the word "window" (such as "Living Room Window")
* Reports Battery Level (where available).

Limitations:
